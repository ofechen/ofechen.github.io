      First of all, welcome to our apartment and thank you for helping take care
      of Nuni. <br />
      Feel free in our place, everything is for you to use, any food is for you
      to eat. <br />
      We don’t eat meat here, so it’s generally kosher for anyone who keeps
      kosher. <br />
      We just ask for no smoking in the apartment. <br />

          every night at around 8 or 9 pm. She might even expect it from you :).
          But, we also try to make her for them. We usually play with her with
          the feather-on-a-string toy for 10 to 20 minutes before giving her
          about 8 treats. You can find the treats on top of the fridge. The toys
          are either on the floor in the living room or under the TV. We rotate
          them every once in a while to keep things interesting for her :)

          We have a vacuum in the closet in the back office. We use it once or
          twice a week since Nuni sheds a lot of hair during the summer. Feel
          free to use it if the hair bothers you. There’s also a roller for hair
          that you can use for your clothes in the coat closet in front of the
          fridge.
